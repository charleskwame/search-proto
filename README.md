# search-proto
first prototype of an input with a search bar, this took a suprisingly long time to finish.
still not perfect
there may be a better way to do this with js but i haven't researched yet
it will be updated when a new and better alternative approach is found


14 hours later, I just implemented a better solution. updating files now
